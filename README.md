<h1 align="center"> Algorithms with Java </h1>

<p align="center"> A collection of algorithms implemented in Java for practicing and learning. </p>

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains various algorithm implementations in Java, covering topics such as:
- **Mathematical Computations** (e.g., Difference of Sum, GCD, Find Exponent)
- **String Manipulation** (e.g., Replace Character, Palindrome Check)
- **Array and Search Algorithms** (e.g., Trapping Water, Median Search)
- **Binary Tree Algorithms** (e.g., Depth and traversal operations)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- Install [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) (Optional for project management)

### Running an Algorithm

To compile and run a specific Java file, use:

```sh
javac <filename>.java  # Compile the file
java <filename>        # Run the compiled file
```

For example:
```sh
javac GcdApp.java  
java GcdApp  
```

## 📌 Algorithms List

| Algorithm | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| Difference of Sum | Calculates the difference between sum of squares and square of sum. |
| GCD | Finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers. |
| Find Exponent | Computes power of a number efficiently. |
| Palindrome | Checks if a string or number is a palindrome. |
| Median Search | Finds the median in a given list of numbers. |
| Trapping Water | Solves the trapping rain water problem. |
